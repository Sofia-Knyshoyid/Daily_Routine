# Daily_Routine
The work describes the routine through the perspective of conditions and transitions between them.

This program is a simulation of the regular day in life.

There are 7 conditions, 3 of them being randomly caused, and 10 transitions in this implementation of daily routine.

The functional decomposition of the code is used in the module.

The generators and coroutines are used in the work for describing the process.

The interaction with the user is present: the input allows to change conditions, thus modelling the real life choices.
